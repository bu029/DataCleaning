Data Set Description

It experiment was designed for group of 30 volunteers.(age in between 19-48 years).Each person carries out six activities called WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING wearing a smart phone Samsung Galaxy S II on their waist.We found 3 axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The data set contains two parts 70% of the volunteers  for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The accelerometer and gyroscope two sensor signals were used for noise filters and fixed width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap.The sensor acceleration were sed as a low pass filter in body accelaration and gravity.And the variables from the time and frequency domain.
 
 Details of Attributes
 
 Data set has triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration,Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope,activity label,identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment,561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables
